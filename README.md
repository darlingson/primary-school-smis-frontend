# Primary School Student Management Information System (SMIS)

Welcome to the primary school SMIS template! This Vue 3 project in Vite is designed to kickstart the development of a student management information system tailored specifically for primary schools. Below, you'll find information on how to set up the project and customize its configuration.

## Features

### 1. Student Profiles

- Maintain comprehensive profiles for each student, including personal information, academic records, attendance history, and health information.

### 2. Attendance Tracking

- Enable teachers to take attendance electronically, track tardiness, and generate reports to monitor student attendance patterns.

### 3. Grading and Assessment

- Provide tools for teachers to input grades, create assessments, and generate progress reports. Allow parents and students to access grades and performance feedback.

### 4. Curriculum Management

- Allow educators to plan, organize, and manage curriculum content, including lesson plans, syllabi, and educational resources.

### 5. Communication Tools

- Incorporate features such as messaging, announcements, and newsletters to facilitate communication between teachers, students, parents, and administrators.

### 6. Homework and Assignments

- Enable teachers to assign homework electronically, provide instructions, set deadlines, and allow students to submit assignments online. Include features for grading and feedback.

### 7. Resource Library

- Build a repository of educational materials, including documents, presentations, videos, and interactive content, accessible to teachers and students.

### 8. Calendar and Scheduling

- Provide a shared calendar for scheduling events, exams, extracurricular activities, parent-teacher meetings, and other school-related events.

### 9. Student Performance Analytics

- Offer analytics tools to track student progress, identify areas for improvement, and generate insights into academic performance trends.

### 10. Parent Portal

- Create a dedicated portal for parents to monitor their child's academic progress, attendance, behavior, and communication with teachers.

### 11. Admissions and Enrollment Management

- Streamline the admissions process, including online applications, document submission, enrollment management, and registration.

### 12. Financial Management

- Include features for fee collection, billing, payment processing, and financial reporting to manage school finances efficiently.

### 13. Security and Data Privacy

- Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive student information and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For an optimal development experience, we recommend using Visual Studio Code along with the Volar extension. Volar enhances Vue 3 support in VSCode, making it easier to work with Vue files. Simply install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur if it's enabled).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

To ensure TypeScript type support for `.vue` files, we use `vue-tsc` instead of the default `tsc` CLI for type checking. Additionally, Volar helps the TypeScript language service recognize `.vue` types within your editor.

## Customize Configuration

For customization options, refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/). You can tailor the project configuration to suit your specific requirements and preferences.

## Project Setup

To set up the project, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

During development, you can compile and hot-reload the project by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command starts a development server and provides live reloading as you make changes to your code.

### Type-Check, Compile, and Minify for Production

For production builds, use the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command type-checks, compiles, and minifies the project for optimal performance in a production environment.

### Run Unit Tests with Vitest

To run unit tests using Vitest, execute the following command:

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

This command runs unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your codebase.

### Lint with ESLint

To ensure code quality and adhere to best practices, lint your code using ESLint:

```sh
npm run lint
```

This command checks your code for potential errors, stylistic inconsistencies, and other issues according to your ESLint configuration.
